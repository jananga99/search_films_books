This is a personal app developed for movie and TV series enthusiasts. We created this app to help us search for our favorite movies and TV series with ease. We believe in making movie and TV series search more fun and enjoyable.

## TMDB (The Movies Database) API Attribution

We use the TMDB API to power our app. The TMDB API is an amazing resource for movie and TV series information. We acknowledge and appreciate their efforts to provide this API to developers like us.

### Attribution Requirements

In accordance with the TMDB API terms of use, we have included the TMDB logo to identify our use of the TMDB API. We have also included a notice to inform our users that this app uses the TMDB API, but is not endorsed or certified by TMDB. We understand and acknowledge that our use of the TMDB logo must be less prominent than our own app logo.
